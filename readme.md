<h1>Welcome to the NiftyTrail client repository!</h1>

This is a Node.js and Express-based web application built with TypeScript, which uses MongoDB for database storage and Mongoose for object data modeling. The app is designed to help NiftyTrail's customers book their travel experiences and plan their trips with ease.

The repository contains several components that work together to ensure a seamless user experience. Some of the features include user authentication and authorization, booking management, trip planning, and real-time communication between customers and support staff.

Additionally, the app uses AWS for cloud computing and storage services, including AWS Lambda, S3, and EC2. It also integrates with Cloudinary for image and video management, providing a scalable and reliable platform for handling multimedia content.

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies using npm. Once you have set up your MongoDB and AWS credentials, you can run the app locally by typing `npm start` in your terminal. Alternatively, you can deploy the app to AWS by configuring your deployment settings in the AWS console.

Thank you for choosing NiftyTrail and we hope you enjoy using our app!
